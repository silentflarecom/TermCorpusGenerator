# Anti-competitive

## English
Anti-competitive practices are business or government practices that prevent or reduce competition in a market. Antitrust laws ensure businesses do not engage in competitive practices that harm other, usually smaller, businesses or consumers. These laws are formed to promote healthy competition within a free market by limiting the abuse of monopoly power. Competition allows companies to compete in order for products and services to improve; promote innovation; and provide more choices for consumers. In order to obtain greater profits, some large enterprises take advantage of market power to hinder survival of new entrants. Anti-competitive behavior can undermine the efficiency and fairness of the market, leaving consumers with little choice to obtain a reasonable quality of service.
Anti-competitive behavior refers to actions taken by a business or organization to limit, restrict or eliminate competition in a market, usually in order to gain an unfair advantage or dominate the market. ...

反竞争行为是指为防止或减少市场竞争而做出的商业、政治或宗教行为。对商业惯例中某些反竞争行为的道德问题的争论在经济学和流行文化方面一直不断，例如布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀于2012年在欧洲的表演中唱称银行家是“贪婪的小偷”、“强盗贵族”。
虽然说内部竞争的效果通常是毁灭性的。研究指出内部竞争往往会演变成职场斗争，也会反过来对员工士气和生产力造成负面影响，并造成工作压力、职业倦怠等负面影响。甚而有看法认为特定情境下，内部竞争必然是恶性的，像是Tom DeMarco的《怠惰：超越倦怠、忙碌工作，及完全效率的神话》（Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency）一书就有段话说“在知识组织中，没有‘良性’竞争这回事，所有的内部竞争都具毁灭性。我们的工作，在本质上是不能由单一个人独力完成的，知识工作定义上就是合作性的。”（There is no such thing as "healthy" competition within a knowledge organization; all internal competition is destructive. The nature of our work is that it cannot be done by any single person in isolation. Knowledge work is by definition collaborative.）然而来自外部的竞争，可以是带来好处的。研究指出，在面对企业彼此间存在竞争性的环境时，人们会变得更加乐于与同侪合作，并促进生产力，“高风险、高收益”的情境会让人变得更加合作，这被认为是演化心理所致；
