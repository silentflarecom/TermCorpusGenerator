# Allen V. Kneese

## English
Allen Victor Kneese (5 April 1930, Fredericksburg, Texas - 14 March 2001) was an American economist. He was a pioneer in what came to be called environmental economics. He worked at Resources for the Future from 1961 onwards. He earned a Bachelor of Science in economics from Southwest Texas State College in San Marcos, master's degree in economics from the University of Colorado Boulder, and a Ph.D. in 1956 from Indiana University Bloomington.
Kneese' research focussed on the integration of environmental pollution in economic models, and on the use of economic incentives to encourage environmental improvements.
Kneese was the first president of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, and was a founding editor of the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management and Water Resources Research. With John V. Krutilla, he was the inaugural winner of the Volvo Environment Prize in 1990.
