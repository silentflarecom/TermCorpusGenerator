# A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960

## English
A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 is a book written in 1963 by future Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz. It uses historical time series and economic analysis to argue the then-novel proposition that changes in the money supply profoundly influenced the United States economy, especially the behavior of economic fluctuations. The implication they draw is that changes in the money supply had unintended adverse effects, and that sound monetary policy is necessary for economic stability. Orthodox economic historians see it as one of the most influential economics books of the century. The chapter dealing with the causes of the Great Depression was published as a standalone book titled The Great Contraction, 1929–1933.
