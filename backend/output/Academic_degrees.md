# Academic degrees

## English
An academic degree is a qualification awarded to a student upon successful completion of a course of study in higher education, usually at a college or university. Academic degrees are commonly structured in levels, most often categorized as undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. 
The most common undergraduate qualification is the bachelor's degree, although some educational systems also offer lower-level degrees such as the associate degree or the foundation degree. Postgraduate degrees include the engineer's degree, the master's degree, and the doctorate.
In the UK and countries whose educational systems are based on the British system, honours degrees are divided into classes: first, second (broken into upper second, or 2.1, and lower second, or 2.2) and third class.
