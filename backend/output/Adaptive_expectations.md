# Adaptive expectations

## English
In economics, adaptive expectations is a hypothesized process by which people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.  For example, if people want to create an expectation of the inflation rate in the future, they can refer to past inflation rates to infer some consistencies and could derive a more accurate expectation the more years they consider.
One simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{e}}
  
 is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected; 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            −
            1
          
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{-1}^{e}}
  
 is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
 is ...

适应性预期（英文：Adaptive expectations），一个经济学的假说，指人们在对未来会发生的预期是基于过去（历史）的。例如，如果过去的通货膨胀是高的，那么人们就会预期它在将来仍然会高。另外的一个有关如何预期的理论是理性预期。虽然许多宏观经济学家视理性预期为1970年代和1980年代的革命性的改进，但是仍然有一些批评主义者认为应该鼓励回到适应性预期模型。
