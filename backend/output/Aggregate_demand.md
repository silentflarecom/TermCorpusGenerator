# Aggregate demand

## English
In economics, aggregate demand (AD) or domestic final demand (DFD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It is often called effective demand, though at other times this term is distinguished. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country. It specifies the amount of goods and services that will be purchased at all possible price levels. Consumer spending, investment, corporate and government expenditure, and net exports make up the aggregate demand.
The aggregate demand curve is plotted with real output on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis. While it is theorized to be downward sloping, the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu results show that the slope of the curve cannot be mathematically derived from assumptions about individual rational behavior. Instead, the downward sloping aggregate demand curve is derived with the help of three macroeconomic assumptions about the functioning of markets: Pigou's wealth ef...

总需求（英语：aggregate demand，缩写：AD）是一个宏观经济学概念。指一个在一指定时期及物价的经济体系（Y）内对最终物品及服务的需求的总和。这是商品及服务在一个经济体系中任何可能价格水平下会被消费的总量。这是当一国的库存水平是静态时对国内生产总值的需求，它也经常被称作有效需求，尽管其他时候这个术语是区别开来的。
总需求曲线通常被视为向下倾斜，是因为在较低物价水平下需求量会更大的缘故。虽然这在微观经济学中分析单一物品是对的，但在宏观层面这想法并不正确。事实上，总需求曲线向右下倾斜是因为三个不同效应的结果：庇古效应、凯恩斯利率效应、蒙代尔-弗莱明汇率效应。
